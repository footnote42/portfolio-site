### 2. Alignment Check

**Does this fit with:**
- [ ] **Inspire vibe coders mission?** (Will this help someone else take the leap?)
- [ ] **Authentic journey narrative?** (Is this genuinely part of my learning, or trying to look impressive?)
- [ ] **Current learning goals?** (What am I trying to understand right now?)

**Exploration & Challenge:**
- [ ] **Am I exploring an interesting idea?** (Even if it doesn't "solve a problem")
- [ ] **Does this challenge convention or typical AI design?** (Or is it playing it safe?)
- [ ] **Will this be enjoyable to build?** (If it feels like grinding, why am I doing it?)

**If alignment is weak:** What's the actual reason I want to build this? Be honest.
