# Project Philosophy

## Why This Site Exists

This portfolio is my personal playground for learning to code through AI collaboration. It's not about proving I'm an expert developer - I'm not. It's about documenting an authentic journey from "I have ideas but coding seems impossible" to "I can ship functional tools that solve real problems."

If this inspires someone else to try vibe coding, brilliant. If it helps me land opportunities, even better. But primarily, it's for me to look back on and feel proud of what I've built.

## Design Principles

### Authentic Voice Over Polished Professional
This site sounds like me. Conversational, honest about limitations, occasionally irreverent. Professional enough that colleagues won't cringe, personal enough that it's clearly mine.

**In practice:** No corporate speak. No fake testimonials. No pretending I know more than I do.

---

### Mobile-First, Desktop-Friendly
Most people will see this on their phones first. But it should still look intentional on a 27" monitor.

**In practice:** Test on your phone before calling it done. Then check desktop doesn't feel like an afterthought.

---

### Substance Over Flash, But Don't Neglect Joy
Every feature must **do something useful**. Flash is secondary. But once functionality works, add subtle touches that make people smile.

**In practice:** Build the working version first. Then ask: "Where's the moment of delight here?" Could be copy, could be animation, could be an unexpected detail.

Think: **unexpected delight, not flashy showboating.**

### Challenge Typical AI Design
If it looks like every other Claude/ChatGPT-generated portfolio, it's too safe. Bland and repeatable design is lazy. Push back on generic suggestions.

**In practice:** When Claude suggests something that feels "template-y," ask for alternatives. What would make this distinctly yours?

### Professional Standards Without Professional Pretence
Future employers, peers, and colleagues might see this. It needs to be credible without being corporate.

**In practice:** Proofread copy. Test functionality. But don't sanitize personality out of fear.

## What This Site Is NOT

❌ **Not an "I'm an expert coder" portfolio** - I'm learning in public, not pretending expertise  
❌ **Not a "look how much I struggle" sympathy play** - Authentic doesn't mean self-deprecating  
❌ **Not a resume substitute** - It's a showcase of thinking and building, not a CV  
❌ **Not frozen in time** - This will evolve as I learn. Future me will probably cringe at past me. That's the point.  
❌ **Not trying to look like everyone else's portfolio** - Safe is boring.

## Technical Philosophy

### Simple Ships, Complex Can Wait
If there's a straightforward way to solve something, take it. You can always refactor when you understand the problem better.

**Exception:** If the simple solution boxes you into a corner with no escape route, choose complexity. But make it a conscious trade-off.

---

### Mobile Optimization Is Non-Negotiable
Desktop views are important, but mobile is where most people will judge this. If it doesn't work on a phone, it doesn't work.

---

### Functionality First, Aesthetics Second
Get it working, then make it look good. Not the other way around.

But "second" doesn't mean "never." Once it works, polish matters.

---

### Learn By Building Real Things
Academic exercises are boring. Build tools that solve actual problems - even if the "problem" is just "I want to see if this is possible."

## When to Break These Principles

If a principle gets in the way of **learning something important** or **shipping something useful**, break it. Document why. Move on.

This isn't dogma. It's guidance for future you when you're deciding what to build next.
