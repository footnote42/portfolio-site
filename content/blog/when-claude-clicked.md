I started with GitHub Copilot. It was brilliant for getting started - autocomplete on steroids, quick iterations, immediate feedback.

But around week three, I hit a pattern: I'd describe what I wanted, Copilot would generate code, and I'd... not really understand why it worked.

That's when I tried Claude.

## Different Coaching Style

Copilot feels like pair programming with someone who types fast.
Claude feels like pair programming with someone who asks: "Why are we doing it this way?"

The difference showed up immediately. I asked Claude to help with a feature, and instead of just writing the code, it explained:
- Why this approach made sense
- What the trade-offs were
- What I should watch out for later

It wasn't just solving the problem - it was teaching me how to think about the problem.

## Tighter Loop

The other shift: Claude runs in the app. I can describe something, see the output immediately, and iterate without switching contexts.

That sounds minor. It's not.

When the feedback loop is tight, you stay in flow. When it's loose, you lose momentum.

## Still Using Both

I didn't ditch Copilot. But Claude became my default for:
- Planning new features
- Understanding architecture decisions
- Debugging when I'm genuinely stuck

Copilot stayed for:
- Quick autocomplete
- Repetitive patterns

Different tools, different strengths. But Claude was the shift from "I can build this" to "I can understand why this works."

That's the difference.
